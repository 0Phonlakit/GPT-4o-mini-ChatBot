# GPT-4o-mini-ChatBot

## About the website
This website was developed as a learning project to explore the integration of Python, OpenAI, and Streamlit. The primary goal was to create a real-time chatbot application that leverages the OpenAI API for natural language processing and Streamlit for the server-side implementation. The application enables seamless, real-time communication between the user and the chatbot.

## How to use and what you need
* The **requirements.txt** file specifies the primary libraries used in the project:
   * **OpenAI**: This library is responsible for interacting with the OpenAI API to generate text-based responses to user prompts.
   * **Streamlit**: Streamlit is used to create the web application's user interface and manage the application's server.

* To run the application, please follow these steps:
   * **Follow the tutorial**: Refer to the `tutorial.txt` file for detailed instructions.
   * **Create a configuration file**: Create a `config.json` file and add your OpenAI API key, which can be obtained from the OpenAI website.

## Basic usage
1. Create a Python virtual environment: Set up an isolated Python environment for the project.
2. Activate the virtual environment: Activate the newly created virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies: Install the required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.
4. Start the server: Run the command **`streamlit run src/main.py`** to start the Streamlit application. A successful startup will display a message indicating that the app is now accessible in your browser, along with the local and network URLs.
5. Stop the server: Press **`Ctrl+C`** to terminate the server.

## Introduction to the website
This website was created as a learning project to explore the capabilities of Streamlit in building web applications and OpenAI in developing chatbots. The primary function of this website is to provide a user-friendly interface where users can input text-based queries and receive relevant responses generated by a chatbot.

## Website details
The homepage features a simple input field where users can type their questions. Upon submission, the chatbot processes the query and provides a response. This interactive experience is designed to mimic real-time conversations.
